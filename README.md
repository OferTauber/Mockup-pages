# Mockup pages

First exercise in the HTML / CSS course - creating a mockup of the error pages of Dropbox and Pixar.
Use of **basic HTML and CSS only** - Flex or Grid are prohibited.

The project demonstrates the use of padding, margin and float for the exact placement of elements on the screen.

## Environment Variables
Since the instructions in the assignment forbade the use of a grid and flex - the page is not responsive. The display will look similar to the original page on a 1440px X 900px screen.
